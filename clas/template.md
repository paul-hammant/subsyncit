# Subsyncit Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

The following terms are used throughout this contributor license agreement (CLA henceforth):

**You** - the person or legal entity including its affiliates asked to accept this agreement.
An affiliate is any entity that controls or is controlled by the legal entity, or is under
common control with it.

**Subsyncit** - the project being developed at https://github.com/paul-hammant/subsyncit

**Contribution** - any type of work that is submitted to Subsyncit, including any modifications
or additions to existing work.

**Submitted** - work conveyed to the Subsyncit project via GitHub's 'Pull Request' system
(PR henceforth).

## 1. Grant of Copyright License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, You grant Paul Hammant, a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute PR contributions
and such derivative works. Except for this license, You reserve all rights, title, and interest in
your contributions.

If you have an employer, or any organization that may claim intellectual property rights to your
contribution within one or more jurisdictions, you have already gained their permission to submit this
contribution under the terms of this CLA.

## 2. Grant of Patent License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, You grant to the Projectsâ€™ maintainers,
contributors, users and to GitHub a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
sell, import, and otherwise transfer your contributions, where such license applies only to those
patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your contribution or by combination
of your contribution with the project to which this contribution was submitted.

If any entity institutes patent litigation - including cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit
- against You alleging that your contribution or any project it was submitted to constitutes or is
responsible for direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that
entity under this agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 3. Source of Contribution.

Your contribution is either:

* Your original creation.
    * Caveat: work is deemed idiomatic to the extent where any reasonably experienced contributor
    for the same potential contribution would produce the same piece of work. For example "add all
    the odd-number integers from 1 to 100 using Ruby" does not produce much variation, and you are
    free to contribute work that contains such idiomatic fragments.
* Work based upon previous work that, to the best of your knowledge, is covered under an appropriate
  open source license and you have the right under that license to submit that work with
  modifications, whether created in whole or in part by you, or you have clearly identified the
  source of the contribution and any license or other restriction (like related patents, trademarks,
  and license agreements) of which you are personally aware.
